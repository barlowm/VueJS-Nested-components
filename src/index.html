	<h1 class="text-center">Nested Component Data Passing</h1>
	<p>Sample VueJS app to pass simple data from a component nested several levels deep</p>
	<p>Start at the lowest level (credential_input.js) with a custom input field component which accepts input from the user and passes it up to it's parent</p>
	<p>The next level up (credentials.js) has several of the custom input field components that receive data from each sub component and combines them into a single object which is then passed up</p>
	<p>At the top component level (app.js) we have a single object which receives the single component object from it's child, which has all the credential values collected in the "credentials" component</p>
